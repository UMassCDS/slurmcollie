## Initial results

These results are brand-new: I did my first random forest model run on April 23. I've only run a small 
handful of models for one site, Old Town Hill. Here are some results of a representative run.

### Model info

Model name: `r model`  
`r dim(model_fit$train)[2]` variables  
n = `r dim(model_fit$train)[1]` (training), `r dim(model_fit$validate)[1]` (validation)  

Correct classification rate (CCR) = `r round(model_fit$confuse$overall['Accuracy'] * 100, 2)`%  
Kappa = `r round(model_fit$confuse$overall['Kappa'], 4)`  

### Confusion matrix and detailed stats

```{r}
print(saltmarsh::unconfuse(model_fit)$confuse, mode = 'prec_recall')                          # I'll move unconfuse to fit, so won't need it here
```
#### Note

This model targets all 19 subclasses found in the field transects ("class" in the stats table above). See 
the Appendix for a list of all 27 subclasses.

#### Explanations

- The confusion matrix and all stats are based on a 20% holdout set.
- The *confusion matrix* shows which classification errors were made. Values falling on the 
  diagonal were predicted correctly.
- *Accuracy* is the correct classification rate (also known as CCR), the proportion of cases that fall on 
  the diagonal in the confusion matrix.
- The *No Information Rate* is the CCR you'd get if you always bet the majority class. In this particular 
  example, I've balanced the samples (subject to random sampling), so the NIR isn't particularly relevant.
- *Kappa* is a refined version of the CCR that takes the probability of chance agreement into account.
- *Mcnemar's test* only applies to two-class data.
- *Statistics by Class* lists the follwing statistics for each of the 19 subclasses sampled at this site. 
  These all scale from 0 to 1, with 1 generally indicating higher performance (except for prevalence, 
  detection rate, and detection prevalence).
  
  - *Precision*, the proportion of cases predicted to be in the class that actually were (true positives / 
    (true positives + false positives))
  - *Recall*, the proportion of cases actually in the class that were predicted to be in the class (true positives / 
    (true positives + false negatives))
  - *F1*, the harmonic mean of precision and recall; a combined metric of model performance
  - *Prevalence*, the proportion of all cases that are in this class
  - *Detection Rate*, the proportion of all cases that are correctly predicted to be in this class
  - *Detection Prevalence*, the proportion of all cases predicted to be in this class
  - *Balanced Accuracy*, mean of true positive rate and true negative rate; a combined metric of model performance
  - *AUC* (Area Under the Curve) is the probability that the model, for a particular class, when given a 
    random case in the class and a random case from another class, will rate the case in the class higher. 
    Unlike the other statistics, AUC is independent of the particluar cutpoint chosen, and is telling us
    about the performance of the probabilities produced by the model.

#### Comments

Overall, the CCR and other statistics look superb. I'm surprised at how well the model is fitting, even
with relatively small sample sizes (this model only uses 20% of the field data). We can use the by-class
statistics to look for problem classes, though none of them look bad in this example. We're fitting the 
transitional marsh subclasses (3, 4, 5) fairly well, though subclass 4 could use improvement 
(predicting classes along a gradient is inherently tricky). The model even does well with small-sample 
size classes such as 7 and 12.

## Variable importance

This plot summarizes overall variable importance. Only the most important 20 variables are shown. 
Not that *variable* refers to an imagery band, not the entire image; thus an RGB true color image
represents three varaibles, any of which may come into the model separately.

```{r}
plot(model_fit$import)
```

#### Comments

- As you can see, a handful of variables (especially the first, an April low-tide Digital Elevation
model) do the heavy lifting, and many are likely not worth including, especialy the remaining 74 
variables not shown. 
- Note that a high tide image doesn't come in until the 19th most important variable,
indicating that the fit is driven primarily by topography and vegetation rather than directly
by hydrology. 
- This particular fit includes photogrammetry-based DEMs in the two top positions, with one in April and
one in August. Several DEMs representing other seasons come in later. Other runs I've tried have early-late 
pairs high up too. I interpret this as the model using the combination of no vegetation and full vegetation DEMs
to get at canopy height. I'd had high hopes for the LiDAR-based canopy height model, but it comes in quite 
low--the model is preferring photogrammetry-based versions instead.
- Short-wave infrared images come in three times in the first eight variables. In other models I've tried,
  SWIR usually comes out as highly important.

## Example map

This map shows the prediction from this model, zoomed in on a small area (about 1 ha) in Old Town Hill.

```{r out.width = "150%"}
pal <- paletteer::paletteer_d('ggthemes::Superfishel_Stone')
terra::plot(prediction, col = pal, all_levels = TRUE)
```

## Comments and caveats
1. These results are super-preliminary. I expect model fits will generally improve as I refine models. 
   The only obvious places where we're likely to see declines in performance are if it turns out we
   have a spatial autocorrelation problem, and doubtless when we apply a model built on one site to another
   site.
2. These models are based on only 20% of the field points, mostly because I wanted fitting to run fast during
   development.
3. I built the models on 80% of the selected data points (so 80% of 20% of all pixels in field transects), and 
   held out 20% of points for validation. All stats are based on the holdout validation set.
4. I haven't tackled spatial autocorrelation yet. I'm concerned that autocorrelation could be contaminating
   the holdout sets. This may not be a thing, but I want to be sure.
5. I've done some minimal tuning of hyperparmeters, but will do more.
6. Field-based transects are not representative, as several classes were photointerpreted in the lab to get
   sample sizes up. I'm currently balancing representation, as we don't have true representation. Revised 
   transects with polygons labeled by source will be available soon. I'll probably end up using both 
   field-based and PI-based data, but weighting cases by field-based representation so I can drop balancing.
7. I'm currently lightly matching the years field transects and UAS imagery were collected (field data were 
   collected in 2019-20; imagery is from 2018-21). To some extent, the model has been preferring years that 
   match well without me bothering to force matching, but loosely matchings years works a bit better. On the 
   other hand, strictly matching years reduces the amount of available imagery. This will be worth exploring.

## Next steps

1. Assess spatial autocorrelation and decide how sparsely we need to sample the data. Run with more complete
   datasets if that's the thing to do. Perhaps sample data in blocks, so validation data are spatially 
   distant from training data.
2. Try adding derived (NDVI, NWDI, NDRE) and upscaled (focal mean, SD, IQR, maybe 10th and 90th percentile)
   variables.
2. Variable selection: fits may be better with fewer variables.
2. Screen source imagery for missing data and other issues. Pick the best image for each season/year/sensor. 
   Deal better with missing values in source data. Automatically reject images with too much missing data
   in site footprint. Possibly impute missing values.
2. Implement a macro naming system for variables so we can use common names across sites (e.g., 
   `21Aug20_OTH_MidOut_SWIR_Ortho` from Old Town Hill and `17Sep22_RED_Mid_SWIR_Ortho` from Red River could 
   both be referred to as `Late_Mid_SWIR_Ortho`. This will be necessary for cross-site modeling.
2. Multi-stage modeling: try targeting lumped subclasses and then spit these in subsequent models to see if 
   that improves fits. I expect to see performance improvements if we target a smaller number of classes.
2. Try alternatives to random forest. I'm currently planning to try AdaBoost, but there are other options.
   I'm using the `caret` framework, which makes it easy to switch modeling approaches, and there are hundreds
   of choices, a few of which will be appropriate. In any case, do more extensive tuning of hyperparameters.
2. Write the model launching and tracking framework I've envisioned, which will make it easy to launch models
   in parallel as batch processes on Unity, and track model results over time. This will make it possible to 
   run many different models and do preliminary evaluation without producing maps of results. It'll then be 
   straightforward to produce maps of promising models. A setup like this will be necessary for running more
   than a handful of models without losing my mind.
2. Produce models for other sites as Ryan finishes preparing transect data. Peggoty, Red River, Wellfleet,
   and Westport should be ready soon. Try applying models across sites and building models for multiple sites 
   in a cross-validation framework.
