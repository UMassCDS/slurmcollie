#' Return a file name from the local drive, Google Drive, or SFTP
#' 
#' If reading from the Google Drive or SFTP, the file is cached on the scratch drive 
#' (`gd$cache`), and reused as long as it isn't outdated. Get `gd$dir` with sister function [get_dir].
#'
#' Notes:
#' 
#' - this code assumes that all files have unique names, even if from different directories. This
#'   holds true for the UAS salt marsh project, so good enough. *** IF REPURPOSING THIS CODE, beware! ***
#' - cached files are reused if they're not outdated. Downloads from Google Drive or SFTP to Unity are
#'   wicked fast, so don't feel bad freeing up the scratch drive after a run. It's the polite thing
#'   to do.
#' - we don't check for a full cache drive, as the Unity scratch drive has a 50 TB limit and we 
#'   have < 1 TB of data. Again, IF REPURPOSING, beware!
#' - we protect against crashed or interrupted downloads by downloading to a temporary file that 
#'   is renamed after completion.
#' - when reading from SFTP, the entire file must be able to fit in memory. There should be plenty
#'   of room for the files in the salt marsh project.
