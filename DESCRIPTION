Title: A Lightweight Border Collie Eager to Herd Your R Slurm Jobs 
Description: A simple and powerful Slurm job manager for R, slurmcollie makes it easy
    to launch R code as Slurm jobs. It manages many heterogeneous runs, tracking run
    status, errors, logs, and status such as memory and CPU used. Instead of mucking
    around in the depths of Slurm, you should be able to get R jobs running within
    an hour.
